Based on the screenshots the Swing app is using LCD text and the FX app is using
gray-scale, in which case the FX app just needs to enable LCD antialiasing.

This bug should likely be closed as "Not an issue".

There is no test case, so I have to guess what the app is doing. It could be
using the Text node directly and that defaults to grey scale. Whereas controls
will likely default to subpixel if that is the platform default. So it seems
like the app needs to set LCD mode on the Text node.

We don't actually care about JavaFX on Linux. It only works on Windowsâ„¢. Closing
as "Not an enterprise quality issue".
